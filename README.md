# Fruit classification with CNN

---

## Purpose

  The purpose of this project is to correctly classify a set of images showing five different types of fruits using a CNN approach with
  various pre-trained models (VGG16, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0)

---           

## Contents 

  - Main project ( Fruit classification with CNN - final.ipynb)
  - Data splitting python script, which allows to separate the image in train, validation and test set (Data splitting.py)

---

## Usage

  In the main project is present a boolean variable called 'trainn' that allows or not the training, this is 
  necessary because the training of this big CNNs is computationally expensive, so after performed the training 
  once, it's useful to store weights and results in some files for further use.
  For the data, they can be found at [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/fruits-classification)
